docker run --name alpine_container -it --rm alpine /bin/sh

# docker ps

# /bin/ash | /bin/sh | ash | sh

# For interactive processes (like a shell), you must use -i -t together in order
# to allocate a tty for the container process. Specifying -t is forbidden when
# the client is receiving its standard input from a pipe.

# -i Interactive mode (Keep STDIN open even if not attached)
# -t Allocate a pseudo-TTY

# --rm automatically clean up the container and remove the file system when the
# container exits (in foreground processes container file systems can really pile up)

# /bin/ash is Ash (Almquist Shell) provided by BusyBox

# docker ps -a
